THOR
Thor is the famous Norse god associated with thunder and lightning. His other claim to fame is that the weekday Thursday (Thor’s day) was named after him.

In Norse mythology, Thor is an Aesir god who personifies strength and fertility. Generally depicted with red hair and a red beard, he was prominent throughout the history of the Germanic tribes.

Thor carried a hammer called Mjölnir (lightning), which was built by the dwarves and could crush mountains.s
